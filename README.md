## Introduction

This repository hosts the source of `Useful Utility Tutorial`, which is made with `Material for MkDocs`.

`Material for MkDocs` is a powerful documentation framework on top of `MkDocs`, a static site generator for project documentation.

## Local Preview

`MkDocs` includes a live preview server, so you can preview your changes as you write your documentation.
The server will automatically rebuild the site upon saving.

Start it with:

```
mkdocs serve
```

## Online Release

To deploy the project documentation manually, you can just invoke the following command from the directory containing the `mkdocs.yml` file:

```
mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

This will build your documentation and deploy it to a branch `gh-pages` in this repository.
